# Working efficiently


You can do a lot of thing with just the mouse and the popup menus but that would be a mistake, keyboard bindings are much faster and more efficient, including moving elements around.

The mouse shines when quick-linking elements, they allow you to create a base diagram fast but editing and fine tuning goes faster with the keyboard or keyboard + mouse.

Learn the keyboard bindings, they are a very good way to use Asciio.
