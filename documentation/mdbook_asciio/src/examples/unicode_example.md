# Unicode Example

*Asciio* does't generate SVG but, in the spirit of unix tools, rely on another tool
to convert text files to SVG.

The "goat" project (https://github.com/blampe/goat) has been chosen to make the conversion, it must be installed, but you can use any converter you want; I recommend having a look athe ecexelent SVGBob too.

See the "Exporter" section to learn how to write your own.
