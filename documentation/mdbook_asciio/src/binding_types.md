# Bindings types

Asciio input can be done by mouse and keyboard, both are defined in a configuration files that you can change. 

We have put lots of efforts into finding the best bindings but it's still under work. We took a big step and made the bindings more vim-like and it has made the many bindings much easier to remember.

You can do a lot of thing with just the mouse and the popup menus but that would be a mistake, keyboard bindings are much faster and more efficient, including moving elements around.

The mouse shines when quick-linking elements, they allow you to create a base diagram fast but editing and fine tuning goes faster with the keyboard or keyboard + mouse.

Learn the keyboard bindings they are a very good way to use Asciio.
