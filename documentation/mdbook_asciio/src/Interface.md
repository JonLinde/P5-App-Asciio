# Interface

Asciio input can be done by mouse and keyboard, both are defined in a configuration files that you can change. 

minimal interface 

- keyboard bindings
- mouse binidings
- popup menus

The bindings more vim-like and which make the many bindings much easier to remember.

You can do a lot of thing with just the mouse and the popup menus but that would be a mistake, keyboard bindings are much faster and more efficient, including moving elements around.

The mouse shines when quick-linking elements, they allow you to create a base diagram fast but editing and fine tuning goes faster with the keyboard or keyboard + mouse.

Learn the keyboard bindings they are a very good way to use Asciio.
