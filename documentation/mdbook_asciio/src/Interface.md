# Interface

Asciio input is from mouse and keyboard bindings, they are defined in a configuration files that you can change. 

Asciio's interface is minimal by design.

## keyboard bindings

This is the preferred method, and the fastest. The bindings are vim-like and which make the many bindings much easier to remember. See the *Bindings* section

## mouse binidings

Although work can mostly be done  using the keyboard, the mouse is still useful in some ccases (selecting in a TUI is difficult) and it even shines when creating new diagrams. See *Working efficiently*

## popup menus

My least favorite way of using Asciio, it's slow and cumbersome for most actions. I try to reduce the amount of menu and sub menus.
