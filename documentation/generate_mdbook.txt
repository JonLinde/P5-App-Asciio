install mdbook from: https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html

$> cd to $ASCIIO/documentation/mdbook_asciio
$> mdbook serve --open # will open the documentation in your browser


Tips:

The main entry point in the documentation is $ASCIIO/documentation/mdbook_asciio/src/SUMMARY.md

if you add a section in that file (while "mdbook serve" is running) and save it, the file for that new section is automatically created

while editing any of the md files, save and the documentation will be updated in the browser within a second or so
